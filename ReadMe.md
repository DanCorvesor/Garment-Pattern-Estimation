# Estimating 2D pattern from a 3D garment

Provides tools to train and run the pattern prediction model on 3D garment geometry 

## Data

This NN training code uses dataset created with [Garment-Pattern-Generator](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator).
* Data is available from Zenodo: [Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns
](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549)

## Docs

1. Installtion instructions: [Installation](docs/Installation.md)
2. How to run training and evaluation: [Running](docs/Running.md)


## TODO
* Documentation -- how to run training \ evaluation
* Anonimous mode
* Locally stored trained models
* Clean configs
