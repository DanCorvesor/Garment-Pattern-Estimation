# NeuralTailor: Reconstructing Sewing Pattern Structures from 3D Point Clouds of Garments

![Overview of the Neural Tailor Pipeline](img/header.png)

Official implementation of [NeuralTailor: Reconstructing Sewing Pattern Structures from 3D Point Clouds of Garments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13063). Provides our pre-trained models, scripts to evalute them, and tools to train framework components from scratch.

| :zap:        Our NeuralTailor paper was accepted to SIGGRAPH 2022!   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Dataset

For training and evaluation, NeuralTailor uses dataset created with [Garment-Pattern-Generator](https://github.com/maria-korosteleva/Garment-Pattern-Generator).
* Dataset is available from Zenodo: [Dataset of 3D Garments with Sewing Patterns](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5267549)

## Docs
Provided in `./docs` folder

1. Installtion instructions: [Installation](docs/Installation.md)
2. How to run training and evaluation: [Running](docs/Running.md)
